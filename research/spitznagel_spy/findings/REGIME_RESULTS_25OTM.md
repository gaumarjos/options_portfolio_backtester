# Regime results at 25–30% OTM (the depth the data actually supports)

The article's 40–45% OTM band is not listed in the pre-2003 SPX chain
(see [`DATA_COVERAGE.md`](DATA_COVERAGE.md)). 25–30% OTM fills every rebalance
back to 1996, so it is the deepest band that gives a trustworthy hedged-vs-
unhedged comparison across all crash regimes. These are those numbers.

**Config:** SPX, strike-based 25–30% OTM puts, DTE 90–180 entry / exit at
DTE 30, bi-monthly rebalance, daily exit checks, monetize-and-reinvest,
externally-funded annual budget, runtime invariants armed. `Fill` is the
engine's hedge fill-rate (`engine.option_fill_rate`); rows below ~90% are
flagged.

## Interpretation

- **Dot-com — hedging genuinely loses.** −0.5 to −1.7pp excess *and* no
  drawdown protection (DD slightly worse). This is a real slow-grind result at
  95% fill, not a coverage artifact. The −1.73pp here is the figure the
  top-level README cites as "dot-com −1.7pp"; it has always been the 25–30%
  number, so that headline is sound — only the separate *40–45%* dot-com run
  was the broken (46%-fill) one.
- **GFC and COVID — hedging pays.** +2 to +6pp (GFC) and +4 to +11pp (COVID),
  with genuine drawdown protection (GFC −56.8 → −47.7; COVID −33.9 → −28.5).
  Fast crashes fall far enough, fast enough, to reach the strikes before the
  90–180-DTE puts roll off.
- **Full 1996–2025 — roughly neutral.** +0.5 to +0.95pp with modest DD help.
  The article's strong full-period result is largely a 2008-start effect; the
  dot-com grind and the calm 2010s offset the crash wins.

Net: the **crash-*shape* thesis holds cleanly at a depth the data supports** —
deep-OTM hedging wins in fast crashes, bleeds in slow grinds, and nets out
near-neutral over a full multi-cycle history.

## Fill-rate caveat (1.0%-budget rows)

The GFC and COVID **1.0%-budget** rows fill only 79% / 82% — **not** missing
strikes but *affordability*: implied vol spiked during those crises, so some
25–30% OTM puts cost more than the thin per-rebalance budget and were skipped
(the `qty == 0` pre-filter). The hedged excess on those two rows is therefore
slightly understated. The **3.3%-budget rows fill 100%** and are the cleaner
read for the crash windows.
